# 👋 Hey, I’m Swee Tien

### 🚀 Full-Stack Engineer • DevSecOps Architect • Web3 Tinkerer

I'm a builder. Whether it's shipping a zero-to-one fintech protocol, engineering secure systems for a global automaker, or scaling infrastructure across clouds — I bring clarity, velocity, and first-principles thinking to every problem I solve.

- 🛡️ **DevSecOps @ Scale**: AKS, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Datadog — automation and observability in my sleep.
- 🧱 **Web3 Ready**: Smart contracts with Solana Anchor, stablecoin settlement rails with Ethereum & Stellar.
- 🔄 **System Builder**: Kafka, Kubernetes, microservices — I thrive in complex, distributed architectures.
- 💡 **Startup DNA**: Founder in Residence @ Antler, built an AI-driven B2B payment protocol using stablecoins.

### 🧠 What I’m About

I don’t do boilerplate. I think from first principles, move fast without breaking things, and deliver rock-solid systems that scale. I’m comfortable owning backend, frontend, infra, and everything in between. People call me a full-stack dev. I call it being responsible.
